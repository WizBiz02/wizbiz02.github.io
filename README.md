This is my first attempt to making a custom website. I have had it with the website builders of the world and would like to take a crack at the hard work required to make my own. I am hoping that this will serve as vehicle that will force me to relearn webdev in efforts to better use my coding powers for good. 

This will also serve as a cringe-worthy reminder that we all start somewhere and I think it would be fun to check back on history of this project and see the progress that I have made.
