    For academic <link href="https://www.jwisby.com/">CV</link> and <link href="https://www.jwisby.com/">Portfolio</link>.

    This site is to be the connection to the things that I have done that do not quite make the cut to make it onto my CV. Most of the things on here are coding projects that I am really proud of, other are tangentally related projects that do require some skill that I am also proud of. Infact, this website itself is all handcoded and (hopefully) serves as one of the projects. These projects are not meant to be a complete list of all the things I have done, but rather a list of things that I have done that I think are worth mentioning. They also range from simple to techinically impressive and everything in between.

    <h2>Visual Aid Development using Tikz</h2>
    <h5>Illustrative Mathematics, Apr 2018 - Dec 2020</h5>
    <img  width =80% loading="lazy" src="assets/CountingBlocks.jpg"  alt="A sampled elementary school visual aid" class="decorated">
    <p>The largest task that I was assigned at my time at Illustrative Mathematics (IM) was creation of visual aids for the IM curriculum. Over my two and a half years at the company, I made over 10,000 unique images to compliment the material. I ended up being image lead for the elementary expansion and used my knowledge of tikz and pgf to redesign our materials to best suit the young audience. After a lot of feedback from my peers, we were able to find designs that best complimented the growth of the students from kindergarden through fifth grade. As I was transitioning towards graduate school, I built a framework of custom classes and packages that would optimize the production of the images and wrote extensive guide books to help the company keep working on their tasks. These images that I was able to make and maintain over the two years I was there contained millions of lines of code. I value my time at IM for many reasons, one of the big ones was oppritunity to contribute so integrably to these projects. I felt that this job is what forced me to approch the areas of programming that I had been avoiding. Because of that, I know I am a much better programmer today than I was just a short while ago.</p>
    <p>Since the material is still in active use and all images and materials are (perhaps not legally, but ethically) owned by IM. Besides, there would be a lot of graphs and it would be a very boring viewing experience. Please use the image provided to get the vibe. </p>
