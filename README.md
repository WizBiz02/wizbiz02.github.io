Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to share with you some of the projects! You'll find examples of my programming projects, from small scripts to larger applications, as well as some of the digital fabrication work I've done. I hope that browsing through my projects will give you a sense of my skills and interests. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in working together on a project. Thanks for stopping by!
