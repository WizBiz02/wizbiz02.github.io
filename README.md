Refresh of a graph
Vertex (Nodes or Points), Sometimes named, sometimes numbered, Draws Vertices

Edges:Unordered pairs connecting two vertices. (Can be directed, or weighted) Draws Edges

Graph, G= ({1,2,3,4}, {(1,2),(1,3),(3,4),(2,3)})G=(1,2,3,4,(1,2),(1,3),(3,4),(2,3))

Graph Rules

Finite (for us)
No Loops
No Multiple Edges
Adjacency : v\sim wv∼w

Order, |V|∣V∣

Size, |E|∣E∣

(This is all just recall)
