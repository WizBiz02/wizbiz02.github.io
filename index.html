    <h2>A bit About Me</h2>
    <h5>Title description, Dec 7, 2017</h5>
    <div class="fakeimg" >Image</div>
    <p>   I was born and raised in Michigan, but ended up moving down to Miami with my partner in pursuit of higher education in 2019. Since then, a pandemic happened and has locked me inside with my books. Now that the pandemic is easing, I am glad that I no longer have to progress with my studies alone.</p>
    <p> I am a graduate student with the department of Mathematics and Statistics at Florida Int. Uni. My long term goal is secondary education instruction and mathematics research. I am proud of all the hard work that I have put into my studies and very excited about where my studies are leading me.</p>
    <p> Outside of my traditional educational experiences, I have spent a lot of my professional and personal time working on computer science and digital fabrication which I honed during my years in Flint while studying Mathematics and Physics at University of Michigan Flint. My coding skills later got me noticed by Illustrative Mathematics, where I worked for nearly three years before I transitioned into graduate student life at FIU.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Current Goal</h2>
    <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
    <div class="fakeimg" >Image</div>
    <p>I am working towards my Masters of Science in Mathematical Sciences at Florida International University. In 2020, I was offered a position to study at FIU in their masters program. Most of my courses have focused on analysis and computation, both fields that I hope to use later in life. So far I have been enjoying myself and hope to graduate in Spring of 2022. </p>
